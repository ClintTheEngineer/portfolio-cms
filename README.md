# portfolio-cms

Core Features still missing:
Update editor table to include user info, so multiple users can have different uploads.
Update API endpoints so images and text data can be retrieved remotely.
Add a visual dashboard that shows current portfolio set up (if any) for whichever user is logged in.

Also:
Update UI and ensure site is fully responsive.
